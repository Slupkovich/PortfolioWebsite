  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?

  Since the assignment is how I see myself in 10 years time , I must say that anyone who gets asked this type of question, will answer it with optimism.  Having surfed the internet, I understood the main parts must be about: Me Intro, About me, and Future me.

  I am an ambitious individual and am aiming high as life is short and I have too much to lose so gotta get down to work if you understand me.</p>

  <h3>Background
  Who is your audience?</h3>

  <p>Audience will be those who know me and would like to hear what is my vision for life in this world.
  * Portfolio 1 (and thoughts about it)
      * Jigar Sable Porfolio Website.
  	Having observed this individuals portfolio website, it shows to me 	that he is educated in the world of creative coding and overall his 	work is very nicely done.


  * Portfolio 2 (and thoughts about it)
      * Personal Porfolio of Coding Nepal.
  	Having then stumbled upon this website, I understood that all personal websites follow the same structure and display nearly the same layout.

  * Portfolio 3 (and thoughts about it)
      * Lastly, Having come to Bedimcode personal website, I was very impressed on the detail and fluidity of the website, but that level that they have done it at, has really set a standard on what a personal website should look like.

  <h3>Planning</h3>
  <p>* Accessibility aspect 1
      * Website is Fluid
  * Accessibility aspect 2
      * Website had a Navigation bar
  * Accessibility aspect 3
      * Colour contrast to show what’s important for me to show off.

  How have you made the site easy to navigate?

  I have implemented a navigation bar so the user can jump around the website.</p>

  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p>Learning
  * During the working of my website, I knew that not all users will have the same screen size like mine and hence I had to make the website accessible for all screen types that are available. I put media query into use and have manipulated it in ways that I didn’t even know about. Furthermore, container boxes within the page, I wanted to make a nice spacing between all information and had educate myself a little on the boxing topic. In essence, I learnt a good amount @media and container boxing.

  	I researched everything on YouTube, since my lecturer was off 		lecturing for a good while, I had to educate myself on how to do few things. For my page “Future” I took the code from a YouTube video and modified it in ways that suit me to display the information that I wanted to display.
  Libraries and other resources
  * I wanted to to include Javascript file onto my home page, but I tried multiple times to get a specific part working but couldn’t and hence left it out. Only plug in that I am using the a bootstrap one for my contact page.</p>

  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <h4>What worked well</h4>
  <p>* What i believe worked well in my work is the fluidity of the website and that the navigation bar works well in all scenarios you put it in the website. Reason why im happy with the Nav bar is that when screen size decreased on some pages, when pressed onto the burger menu to display other links, I had information and buttons leaking through the Burger menu and it took me a while to fix the bug.
  * I am also happy that the resizing of the screens on all the pages work very well. Knowing that there are users who have different type of screens, media queries had to be implemented in order for the website to be fully accessible to all users.
  * Lastly, im happy with the colour scheme chosen, I feel like it easy on the eyes and what I want for the user to specifically to see, I have made that happen.</p>

  <h4>What might be improved</h4>
  <p>* JavaScript implementation; I wanted to add in some features onto the home page of the website but I just couldn’t get it working and the console wasn’t been clear for me to understand what was the issue.
  * Hoverable items; I have only one cool feature implemented onto the Home Screen of the website but I have picked it out from another portfolio website and modified it in my own way.
  * Scrolling and disappearance of the nav bar: I could have made my nav bar little more complex in design but I stuck with being simple as im only an amateur in this.</p>
